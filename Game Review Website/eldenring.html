							<p id="eldenp"><strong>Elden Ring is the new game from FromSoftware, the studio behind the notoriously challenging Dark
							Souls series. While the game's graphics and story have been generating a lot of buzz, it's the gameplay that really
							shines in Elden Ring. The combat is fast-paced and precise, with a wide range of weapons and abilities to choose from.
							The open-world exploration is equally impressive, with a vast and interconnected world that rewards players for
							their curiosity and exploration. The game's bosses are challenging and memorable, as is typical of FromSoftware's 
							games. While the game's difficulty may turn off some players, it's exactly what fans of the studio have come to 
							expect and love. The game's co-creator, George R.R. Martin, doesn't add much to the game's overall experience, but
							his involvement is still a nice touch. Overall, Elden Ring is a solid addition to FromSoftware's impressive lineup,
							and it's sure to satisfy fans of the studio's previous titles. Elden Ring lives up to the hype and expectations,
							it has become the standout game of the year, if not the generation. Based on what we've seen and played,
							I would tentatively give Elden Ring a rating of 9 out of 10.</strong></p>
