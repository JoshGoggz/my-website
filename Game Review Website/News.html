				<article class="newsarticle">
					<h3>Whats New in Destiny's Latest Season!</h3>
					<p id="newspara">
						<strong>Destiny 2's Season 20 comes packed with significant changes, including fresh
						Guardian subclasses, a new campaign, modifications to Umbral Engrams, and 
						seasonal currencies. We haven't had too much time to try out the new Strand
						Subclass but what we have used of it, it is a dream to zip around and outplay 
						your enemies either in PvE or PvP. The campaign so far is incredibly gripping.
						We are super excited to see what is yet to come in this new season. As the Lightfall
						reveals more secrets, this list will be updated with new guides and walkthroughs to help players survive the 
						treacherous streets of Neomuna and the Witness's ominous plans. A typical
						Destiny 2 season lasts for approximately three months, and although the 
						official end date for Season 20 has not been announced, it will probably
						end in May or April's final weeks. With a few months to prepare, there 
						should be ample time to get everything needed to defy the Witness. In the 
						meantime, enjoy the game!<br></strong>

				<article class="newsarticle">
					<h3>Golden-Gun Mode has reignited the Siege Community, Well Done Ubisoft</h3>
					<p id="newspara">
						<strong>Rainbow Six Siege has had various limited-time events in the past,
						with the possibility of more in the future. One such event that players really
						enjoyed was the "Six Invitational 2021" event that occurred earlier this year.
						The event introduced a fresh game mode named "Golden Gun" where players had
						to eliminate one another using a one-hit-kill golden gun, as well as several
						new cosmetics such as weapon skins, headgear, and uniforms. The Six Invitational
						2021 event was well-liked by the Rainbow Six Siege community, leading to an
						increase in the number of players during its duration. In general, these
						limited-time events provide an exciting way to keep players interested
						and engaged in the game, while also offering an opportunity to introduce
						new content and features.<br></strong>

					<h2 id="newsh2">Has Warzone 2.0 started to roll down hill with its player count at an all-time low?</h2>
				</header>
				<img id="warcover" src="image/warcover.jpg"></img>
				<article class="newsarticle">
					<h3>Will W2 player count continue to drop or will it be revived?</h3>
					<p id="newspara">
						<strong>Unsurprisingly, MW2 and Warzone 2 were most popular during the first weeks after
						the release, so in November 2022. According to Steam, about 224,000 people played the game on
						average in November, with an all-time peak of 488,897 players.<br><br>

						About six months later, the average number of players decreased significantly to less than
						90,000 in the last 30 days, with a peak of around 157,000 players. This indicates that the
						game lost over half of its player base compared to the launch weeks. It's worth noting that
						the player count on Battle.net, Xbox, and PlayStation would have to be combined to determine
						the overall number of players, but it's difficult because Sony and Microsoft don't offer
						a detailed player count monitoring option like Steam does. However, since the content is
						identical on all platforms and both Warzone 2 and MW2 are crossplay, it's probable that
						the player curve will be comparable across platforms. This sheds light on why Modern
						Warfare 2 and Warzone 2 have experienced a decrease in their player count.<br><br>

						In addition to the typical drop in player and viewer numbers that usually occurs shortly
						after a game's release, many players were dissatisfied with some of the changes made to
						Warzone 2. Some even went so far as to claim that the game was already dead. Moreover,
						the second season of the game was delayed by a whole month, and not every player may
						have been willing to wait an extra four weeks to finally experience some new content.
						Ultimately, the decrease in the number of people playing Call of Duty MW2 and Warzone
						2 is probably due to a combination of various factors mentioned in this article.<br></strong>
