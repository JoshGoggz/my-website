						<p>Wow! Just finished playing The Last of Us 2 and it was just amazing. The storyline,
						characters, gameplay and graphics were just out of this world. Naughty Dog have just raised
						the bar for every game to come out this generation. This game brings in emotions you didn't even
						know you have and it leaves a feeling you just can't shake. I finished the game yesterday
						morning and I can't stop thinking about it!!!! This is defo in my top 5 list with God of war
						and Elden Ring up there with it. If you havent started The Last of Us 1 to be able to play the 2nd part then get started!!! 
						You won't be disappointed. That I can guarantee.<br><br>

						<p>Marvel's Spiderman is every spiderman fans dream. The web swinging and combat feel just as it should 
						for a spiderman game. The storyline was okay but what really drives the game is the swinging and movement.
						I would genuinely just play this game to swing around and stop crime. There is so many spiderman games that
						have come out before this but it never really felt like a superhero game. Marvel's Spiderman on the other hand is
						a breath of fresh air making you feel like you are really flying between the streets of New York as your very own
						friendly neighbourhood superhero. <br><br>

						<p>Meg I was recommended God of War by Josh and it was phenomenal!! I absolutely fell in love with
						Kratos and Atrues' relationship. Their relationship I would say is quite harsh, unique and difficult at the beginning but
						quickly starts to gorw into something amazing and so heartfelt. It really brings you along for the ride.
						Without spoiling anything the twists and turns this game has, makes you wanna play it over and over again.
						I havent been engulfed by a games environment since I played Horizon Zero Dawn a few years ago. This game for me is top-tier
						and I don't say such things lightly ;]. 100% recommend!!!. <br><br>

						<p> Red Dead Redemption 2 is absolutely out of this world. It was such a long game if you playing all the campaign and
						side missions and I am here for it !!!!. The gameplay and charaters were just so well made and the atmosphee of the whole
						game keeps you on your feet!!!.Its full of a rollercoaster of emotions and brings the excitement into what western games should be.
						Ive only dabbled on the online aspect of it but so far im having a a blast. It really does make you appreciate its predesessor
						Red Dead Redemption since it was 4-8 years after the events of Red Dead 2.The western timeline is created with such finess,
						realism and detail making it extremely difficult to fault. To anyone thinking of starting this game, be ready for a wild ride.<br><br>
