							<p id="lastp"><strong>The story of The Last of Us is one of the most gripping and emotionally charged narratives
							in all of gaming. Set in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a fungal infection that turns humans into monstrous

							on the last to create a sense of tension and urgency that never lets up. The game's characters are fleshed
							out and nuanced, with Joel and Ellie's relationship at the center of the story. As they journey together,
							they face countless challenges and horrors, and the game's emotional and gut-wrenching moments are some
							of the most memorable in all of gaming. The Last of Us is a game that will stay with you long after you've
							put down the controller, and its story is a testament to the power of video games as a storytelling medium.</strong></p>
